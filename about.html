    <h3>About High Five &amp; Plus Deltas</h3>
    <p>
      This tool helps you get inspiration for what to talk about during plus deltas.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus deltas are a simple method for individuals or teams to engage in reflection as an
      approach to continuous improvement. The +/∆ evaluation can help inform the changes needed to achieve higher
      levels of performance. Set aside 5 minutes at the end of each day to discuss what went well and what
      had room for improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teams can sometimes struggle to find a good starter for their +/∆. This is where
      High Five comes in by offering suggestions with sometimes positive, sometimes
      neutral and sometimes intentionally provocative statements for your team to
      discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's recommended to set a collective reminder in your team's calendar for every
      day.
